% of rolling a sum of seven is 6/36 or 1/6. I arrived at this answer since

% so 6*(1/36) is 6/36 or 1/6. This means it is more probable to roll a sum
% of seven than it is to roll snake eyes since 1/6 is greater than 1/36.

% Mean
% From the plot in the previous problem, the mean is 7. The mean is given

% is consistent with the mean shown in the graph since mean is 7. Another
% thing to point out is the mean of one die is 3.5 so the mean of n die is
% simply n times 3.5. In this case, we have two dice so 2*3.5 = 7 which is
% consistent with the previous two methods. 

x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6];
mean = sum(x)/6;
disp(mean);

% Variance
% The variance is given by sum[(x-mean)f(x)]. From the previous part, we
% know f(x)=1/6 for all values since there is an equal chance to roll each
% value. Also, the mean for one die is 3.5 and the values of x are
% [1,2,3,4,5,6]. So if we compute the variance of one die, we get 2.196.
% Now, if we want the variance of two dice, we simply multiple the variance
% of one die by two which gives us a result of 5.833. This means you can
% simply multiply n to the variance of one die to find the variance of n
% die. This is because they are independent of one another. 

variance = 0; 
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
for c = 1:length(x)
variance = variance+(x(1,c)-3.5)^2/6;

% pdfs, we can see how the Central Limit Theorem takes effect. Therefore, I
% would say this is a Gaussian distribution. 

%% Problem 5
% This part shows that the sum of an initially Gaussian distribution is
% also a Gaussian distribution. This is shown by defining two Gaussian
% distributions "gdist1" and "gdist2" and a third Gaussian distribution
% "gidst3" which is the sum of the first two Gaussian distributions. I plot
% each of them on the same plot to show all three functions and how each
% have characteristics of a Gaussian distribution. 
x = -15:15;

% From the plot of Distribution 1, 2, and 3 (D1, D2, and D3 respectively),
% we know the standard deviation of the resulting sum or average Gaussian
% distribution changes. The standard deviation of D1 and D2 are 4 and 3
% respectively. In order to calculate the standard deviation of D3, we must
% find the variance of D3 first since variance is equal to the square of
% the standard deviation. So the variance of D3 is equal to the sum of the
% variance of D1 and D2 which is 4^2 + 3^3 = 25. Now, the standard
% deviation of D3 is 5. Thus, this shows how the standard deviation of the
% resulting sum of Gaussian distributions changes. The average of D3 is
% simply the sum of the averages of D1 and D2 which are 3 and 2
% respectively. So the average of D3 is 5. This means if we explore a
% signal over a long period of time, we will expect the standard deviation
% to increase which corresponds in a wider width in the Gaussian
% distribution. This makes sense since we expect noise to affect our data.
